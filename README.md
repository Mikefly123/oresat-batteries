#OreSat Battery Board V2.0##The Jeremey Clarkson Methodology to Power Management (MORE POWAAHH)The OreSat Power Domain (OPD) is designed with modularity as a key factor in design decisions.  We are confident that our system will behave spectacularly in flight (whether that is spectacularly well or spectacularly bad remains to be seen).##Battery Pack TopologyEach OreSat battery card has 2 battery packs, each pack consisting of 2S 18650 LiPo cells.  We will be flying two battery cards connected to the OPD, both to keep our center of mass balanced around our geometric center, and for the added capacity.  Despite this, each card is independent and the OPD is fully capable of functioning with only one active card.We decided to separate the packs instead of combining them into a single 2S2P pack for the sake of redundancy, we can lose one cell and the other pack can still provide power to the OPD, as opposed to losing an entire card from a single cell failure.  This design does come with the added drawbacks of extra overhead in the form of requiring more charge protection and fuel gauge circuitry.  ##Charge/Discharge Protection##Fuel Gauge and Cell Health Monitoring# Current Design Documentation- [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m6FopMepRnWKUnyaSLvasRHum4sx9E_MLduOtIjwnw8/pub)- If you need editing permission ask either Austin or Andrew
